# What is Rotating-Screens

A cool project shared with the open source community that allows you to rotate through different screens for websites, twitter, youtube, and powerpoint slides. It's aimed to be used in the office to display their desire list of webpages or custom messages. The master branch is updated with the most current version of this project. Rotating-screens is in a constant work, any feedbacks would be greatly appreciated!
